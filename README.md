# Spooky Southampton

This project was created as a competition entry for a Code First Firls Advance Python Community Course.

The motivation behind this project was to create a basic website where I could implement the skills learnt on the course: *Python, Flask, CSS, HTML and Javascript,* as well as implement a simple web map based on *Leaflet.*

The website template is built upon the one page Bootstrap *Greyscale theme.*

The website is accessible at https://powerful-brushlands-30827.herokuapp.com/
