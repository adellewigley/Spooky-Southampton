+## Spooky Southampton
+
+ This project was created as a competition entry for a Code First Firls Advance Python Community Course I attended.
+
+The motivation behind this project was to create a basic website where I could implement the python, flask, bootstrap, and a simple web map.
+
+The website is accessible at https://powerful-brushlands-30827.herokuapp.com/
